        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Lasagna</strong>, which is also known as <em>lasagne</em>,<br>
            is both the name of the dish and the name of the pasta.<br>
            Eaten chiefly sliced, but prized, both fresh and smoked,<br>
            in true Italian one-dish meals such as Lasagne and Pizza.<br>
            Come to devour them ... finger licking good !...</p>
